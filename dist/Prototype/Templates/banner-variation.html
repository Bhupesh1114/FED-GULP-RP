                  <p class="detail__text__container__desc">St. Luke’s NICUs are certified to provide advanced medical care to critically ill newborns and premature babies. Both NICUs are recognized in the "Vermont Oxford Network," a national network of NICUs formed to evaluate quality and outcomes of neonatal practices. <br><br>
                      Staffed 24/7 by fellowship-trained, board-certified neonatologists, along with neonatal nurse practitioners and a team of specially trained nurses, lactation consultants, occupational and physical therapists, the NICU offers the very latest in technology and developmental techniques. St. Luke’s NICUs are equipped to perform CT scans, echocardiograms, EKGs, EEGs and ultrasound, among others <br><br>
                      Our practice is to encourage parental involvement in all aspects of care. <br> <br>
                      NICUs at both campuses offer a family waiting room for visitors, a night watch room for parents to spend a night with their baby before going home and a private place to breast-feed or pump. A skilled team of devoted clinicians provides high-level medical care. Special lighting and noise control create an environment that is sensitive to the babies. Nicky's Place, a private home located on site of St. Luke’s Hospital – Bethlehem Campus is available for parents to stay when their babies are patients in the NICU. <br> <br>
                      Tours of the NICU are available to those who anticipate a high-risk delivery. <br> <br></p>

                      NICU - Family Support
                      <br> <br>
                      This is one of the first licensed programs within the state of Pennsylvania and establishes St. Luke’s as a participant with 70 other NICU's nationwide. In fact, St. Luke’s was the recipient of the 2015 March of Dimes first annual Site of the Year Award Winner for our excellent NICU Family Support Program offered at both St. Luke’s University Hospital – Bethlehem and St. Luke’s Allentown Campus.
                      <br> <br>
                      The network serves to help parents cope with NICU hospitalization and was created by the March of Dimes, with the assistance of NICU families, who know exactly what other families need.
                      <br> <br>
                      The program is customized to meet the specific needs of the NICU staff and parents and incorporates special components to address the needs of siblings and extended family members. The network also offers continuing education for NICU professional staff on topics related to caring for the critically ill newborn and family centered care.

                  <h1 class="detail__text__container__title">Sound Environment</h1>
                 <p class="detail__text__container__desc">Sound, light, touch and handling are significant environmental factors that play a role in the development of NICU babies. Proper developmental care for these tiny babies can make a big difference. Studies have demonstrated that stress from the environment can prolong hospitalization and compromise outcomes in preterm babies who require intensive medical care. Additionally, undue stress can have long-term consequences on brain development and organization. At St. Luke’s, NICU care is provided by a skilled team of caregivers who offer an environment that is sensitive to the baby's sensory development for 
                  best outcomes.</p>
